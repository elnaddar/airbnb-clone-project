### Database Constraints and Indexes

#### Primary Keys

- All entities have auto-incrementing primary keys for optimal performance
- Primary keys ensure entity uniqueness and serve as the main reference point

#### Foreign Key Constraints

- All foreign keys include referential integrity constraints
- Cascade rules defined for data consistency during deletions
- ON DELETE CASCADE for dependent records
- ON UPDATE CASCADE for primary key updates

#### Unique Constraints

- `Users.email` - Ensures unique user identification
- `Properties.property_id` - Prevents duplicate property listings
- `Reviews.booking_id` - Ensures one review per booking

#### Indexes for Performance Optimization

- **Users**: Index on `email` for authentication queries
- **Properties**: Index on `host_id`, `location`, `price_per_night` for search functionality
- **Bookings**: Index on `guest_id`, `property_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date` for booking queries
- **Reviews**: Index on `property_id` for review retrieval
- **Payments**: Index on `booking_id` and `payment_status` for transaction tracking

### Data Integrity Rules

1. **Business Logic Constraints**

   - Check-in date must be before check-out date
   - Number of guests cannot exceed property's max_guests
   - Rating must be between 1 and 5
   - Price per night must be positive

2. **Referential Integrity**

   - All foreign keys must reference existing records
   - Orphaned records are prevented through cascade rules
   - Booking dates cannot overlap for the same property

3. **Data Validation**
   - Email format validation
   - Phone number format validation
   - Required fields enforcement
   - Enum constraints for status fields

This database design ensures scalability, data integrity, and optimal performance for the Airbnb Clone application while supporting all core functionalities and business requirements.
